OpenMRS Module
==============

.. contents::
   :depth: 3

The OpenMRS module allows MOTECH to integrate with an OpenMRS Platform instance, version 1.9 and higher, which is the core OpenMRS system, running the OpenMRS Reference Application and derivative works like `Bahmni <http://www.bahmni.org/>`_. From a developer perspective, the module provides data models and basic services to represent OpenMRS elements in MOTECH. For the end user, the module presents itself in the tasks module with the ability to query patients, providers and encounters as a tasks data source. Additionally, you use task actions to create patients and encounters in OpenMRS.

About OpenMRS
-------------

"`OpenMRS <http://www.openmrs.org>`_ is a software platform and a reference application which enables design of a customized medical records system with no programming knowledge (although medical and systems analysis knowledge is required). It is a common platform upon which medical informatics efforts in developing countries can be built. The system is based on a conceptual database structure which is not dependent on the actual types of medical information required to be collected or on particular data collection forms and so can be customized for different uses." (`Source <http://openmrs.org/about/>`_)

Feature List
------------
Below is a list of features available in the OpenMRS module

- Configure the server URL through the UI
- Map a patient identifier between MOTECH and OpenMRS to support matching patients across multiple systems
- Query for patients, providers and encounters in a tasks data source
- Create patients from a MOTECH task action
- Create encounters from a MOTECH task action

Setup, Configuration and Connection to OpenMRS
----------------------------------------------
Full setup and configuration instructions are available in our `implementer's getting started page <http://docs.motechproject.org/en/latest/get_started/connect_openmrs.html>`_.

Testing with curl
-----------------
We recommend that you become familiar with the OpenMRS Web Services API endpoints to be able to fully utilize the Tasks data source and actions. This can be done by using curl or online curl tools like `hurl.it <https://www.hurl.it/>`_ to see what's returned by the server. To make this easier, future versions of OpenMRS will integrate `Swagger documentation <http://swagger.io>`_ for the Web Service API. Here are some sample curl statements to get you started

**Get a Patient**

.. code-block:: shell

    curl -u admin:Admin123 http://demo.openmrs.org/openmrs/ws/rest/v1/patient/?q=Johnson

**Get a list of All Encounters for a Patient**

Tasks Integration
-----------------
The OpenMRS module currently acts as a data source and task action. This allows you to query OpenMRS for supplemental information and create patients or encounters when new task triggers are fired. For example, you could create a patient in OpenMRS when a Commcare registration form arrives in MOTECH.

Task Data Source
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The Tasks module queries the OpenMRS Web Services API and makes the results available to the task. These data sources are useful when supplemental information is needed from a task trigger such as patient, encounter and provider information. Click Add data source in the task and choose Source: OpenMRS to make this information available to the task. Each of the following objects are available as a data source. Please reference the `OpenMRS web services documentation <https://wiki.openmrs.org/display/docs/REST+Web+Service+Resources+in+OpenMRS+1.9>`_ for a description of each API call.

- Patient (Lookup by MOTECH ID or UUID)
    This allows you to lookup patient information by MOTECH Id or OpenMRS UUID. Returned fields include Patient UUID, Patient identifiers, MotechId, Person UUID, person display (name), person address (text field), Person age, Person birthDateEstimated flag, Person date of birth, Person date of death, Person created date, Person changed date, New person flag, Person gender and Person dead flag. **Note that New person flag is a 'yes' 'no' string that can be used as a filter.**
- Encounter (Lookup by Encounter UUID)
    This allows you to lookup encounter information by UUID. Returned fields include Encounter UUID, Encounter display (encounter type with date), Encounter date, Encounter type, Provider UUID, Provider display (name), Location UUID, Location display, Patient UUID and Patient display (name).
- Provider (Lookup by UUID)
    This allows you to lookup provider information by UUID. Simply put a provider is a wrapper around the OpenMRS Person with an identifier and name. Returned fields include Provider UUID, Provider identifier, Person UUID, Person display.

Task Actions
^^^^^^^^^^^^
The following OpenMRS task actions are available:

- Create Patient
    This task action allows you to create patients in OpenMRS. The task uses the POST command to the OpenMRS Rest Web Services module. Below is a description of each field in the action.
